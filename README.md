# Genetic Image Matcher

Fun project I made back when coffeescript was the hot new thing. Uses a genetic algorithm to try and evolve a set of randomly generated rectangles into a semblance of a supplied image. Originally inspired by a blog post that I can't find now, there are many [other](https://alteredqualia.com/visualization/evolve/) [examples](https://chriscummins.cc/s/genetics/) out there.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a browser and hit "Go". The "Grab Best Snapshot" button takes the current lowest scoring (closest) image and appends it to the end of the page for easy saving/downloading.
